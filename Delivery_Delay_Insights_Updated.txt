📦 Project: Delivery Delay & Efficiency Analysis

📊 Key Metrics:
- Avg FTL Delay: 5.0 hrs
- Avg Carting Delay: 1.0 hrs
- FTL Trips: 100,000
- Carting Trips: 50,000
- Weighted Avg Delay: 3.67 hrs

🔍 Insights:
• FTL contributes more to delay due to higher avg and volume.
• Delay peaks in Afternoon and Evening; lowest in Morning and Late Night.
• FTL delay max in Afternoon (5.38 hrs); Carting max in Morning (0.97 hrs).
• FTL is 88% slower vs. expected; Carting is 131% slower.
• FTL efficiency = 51.75%, Carting = 43.11% → optimization needed.
• Delay increases with distance: 500+ km = 12.41 hrs, 0–50 km = 0.54 hrs.
• Thursday sees max trips (~26.7k); Monday lowest (~17.8k).

🧮 Scenario Planning:
| Scenario        | FTL | Carting | Overall |
|-----------------|-----|---------|---------|
| Base Case       | 5.0 | 1.0     | 3.67    |
| Optimistic      | 2.0 | 0.5     | 1.5     |
| Worst Case      | 7.0 | 2.0     | 5.33    |
| SLA Pressure    | 2.5 | 1.4     | 2.13    |

✅ Recommendations:
• Prioritize reducing FTL delay in afternoons.
• Fix inefficiencies in routing vs. OSRM benchmarks.
• Spread load better across weekdays.
• Use scenario models to plan ops and manage SLAs.

📘 **Data Dictionary for Better Understanding**


• data - tells whether the data is testing or training data
• trip_creation_time – Timestamp of trip creation
• route_schedule_uuid – Unique Id for a particular route schedule

• Carting: Handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)
• trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and destination centers)
• source_center - Source ID of trip origin
• source_name - Source Name of trip origin
• destination_cente – Destination ID
• destination_name – Destination Name
• od_start_time – Trip start time

• start_scan_to_end_scan – Time taken to deliver from source to destination
• is_cutoff – Unknown field
• cutoff_factor – Unknown field
• cutoff_timestamp – Unknown field
• actual_distance_to_destination – Distance in Kms between source and destination warehouse
• actual_time – Actual time taken to complete the delivery (Cumulative)
• osrm_time – An open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) and gives the time (Cumulative)
• osrm_distance – An open-source routing engine which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) (Cumulative)
• factor – Unknown field
• segment_actual_time – This is a segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery
